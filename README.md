# Music Player UID
### What's this?
The software was developed during June and July 2022 as the final project for the "[**User Interfaces Design**](https://sites.google.com/unical.it/inf-uid)" course.  
The team consisted of (*in a strict alphabetical order*):
  + [**Alessandro Monetti**](https://github.com/AceOfPotatoes), aged 21 (*Graphics, Play Queue, Shuffle Algorithm, Equalizer*);
  + [**Andrea Tocci**](https://github.com/AndreaYpmY), aged 21 (*Database, Playlist, Embryonic pages layouts*);
  + [**Ernesto Rapisarda**](https://github.com/Ernesto-Rapisarda), aged 41 (*Thread(s) management, Metadata handling, Tiled views, Every other thing not mentioned before*).

### What can it do?
 + It can play **.wav** / **.mp3** (*audio*) and **.mp4** (*video*) (*as we were limited by JavaFX's Media class*);
 + It gives you the possibility to create (*and store*), your **personal playlists**, with custom names and custom thumbnails;
 + It "freezes" your **Play Queue** between two different sessions, to pick up where you left off;
 + It has an integrated **equalizer**, which you can use to tune audio frequencies' gain, selecting between 7 presets (*1 of which is customizable*);
 + All other basic stuff you expect a Media Player to do.

### Will it ever be updated?
At the moment we don't know at all, as we are pretty busy with other university courses, let's say it isn't one of our main concerns right now.

### Can I see some of it without downloading it?
